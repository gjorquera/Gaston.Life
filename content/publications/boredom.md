Do you remember a decade or two ago when you were bored? Do you remember how it
felt? Not knowing what to do? Bouncing out ideas with your friends (or imaginary
friends)?

Did you stop to think about how I asked "a decade or two ago" and not "a week
or two ago" or even "a year or two ago"?

When was the last time you were bored?

It's hard to feel bored with the [constant notifications][notifications] and
[noise around][distraction] us due to technology. There's always some way to
live through other people's lives (Facebook, Twitter, TV, etc.).

The constant information streams and technology prevent us from being bored and
it has been replaced with time spent doing useless things. So many things to
keep up with, to watch, to read, to experience through a screen.

Is it really better to mindlessly consume useless stuff instead of accepting
that we might get bored every now and then?

Not for me. So, what can we do about it?

My suggestion is do **nothing**. Just get rid of the idea that you have to
always be doing something.

And, if you feel bored, don't go to your current consumption habits. Don't:

* Open Facebook, Twitter, or the next big social network.
* Watch something on Netflix.
* Turn on the TV.
* Read the news.
* Eat compulsively.

Instead, try to:

* Stop, [breathe][breathe] and accept that you are bored.
* Spend some minutes [meditating][meditation].
* Read a novel for a while.
* Do some [body weight exercises][convict].
* Cook some [healthy snacks][snacks].
* Go out for a walk listening to a [podcast][podcast].
* Go out for a run.
* Go out on an iPhone photography walk.

These are my "don't do list" and "do do list". I encourage you to write your own
and try to follow them.

Feeling bored is not a bad thing. Feeling tired and not wanting to work is not a
bad thing. Just be really conscious about what you decide to do on your current
state.

If you're tired, don't try to meditate as you'll probably fall asleep. Just
accept that you are tired and sleep.

Sorry, but watching TV is not resting.

I know I haven't written about why feeling bored is not that bad. If you avoid
doing things in the "don't do list" when bored then it will open the door for
leisure activities. And, [leisure activities contribute to
happiness][happiness]. [Facebook, my friends, don't][facebook].

Now it's your turn. Go ahead and just stop for a while! Take it easy and don't
be [afraid][afraid] of feeling bored.
