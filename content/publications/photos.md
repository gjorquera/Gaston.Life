  Photography is not only about shooting. There is a process, an important
  process, that must happen after you shoot if you want to improve.

Taking photos helps us remember those moments that are gone forever; our time
spent with friends and family, our trips abroad, our life. They help us remember
places we're not going to visit again, experiences we're not going to live
again, and those who we'll never be able to talk to again.

Even if you have taken photos of your memories, what good are them to you if you
can't find them?

Taking photos helps us remember our life, but without proper photo organization
(however unsexy that might sound), you might still be forgetting every amazing
moment.

Taking photos doesn't end after… taking the photos. If you really want them to
add value to your life, you have to import them, group them, review them and
select them.

In this article I'll tell you what I learned after 6 months of looking,
organizing, and reviewing over 10 thousand photos taken throughout 6 years.

## Step 1: Get Them Into One Place

Do you have photos in several SD cards, external hard drives, digital cameras or
notebooks? Well, then this is your first step.

> Get all your photos into one place!

It doesn't matter where you put them as long as all of them are in one place.

In the future, you will start thinking about your past, about the things you've
done, and the people you've met. Having all your photos in one place will help
you avoid having to remember where you left them.

## Step 2: Sort Out the Mess

Looking through several thousand photos trying to pinpoint a particular memory
isn't the best way to go.

If you look at all your photos, you'll probably be able to identify a handful of
themes. Maybe you usually take photos of your friends, nature photography, and
vacations. Maybe it's photos of flowers, portrait photography, and trekking. You
get the idea.

I usually take photos of events (family or friends gatherings, concerts,
expositions, etc), travel photography (weekend at the beach, vacations abroad,
etc), and deliberate practice photos.

So, the first level of organization are: events, travel, and practice.

> Create top level folders for each of your identified themes.

To avoid having too many projects side by side on each of these folders, I group
them by year. I usually remember the year on which the particular project I'm
looking for was taken, so this helps me to filter them quickly.

Inside the year folder, I store all the projects I took on that year, following
this naming format: "YYYY-MM-DD~DD | Event Name"

For example, "2015–06–24~26 | Weekend at San Pedro de Atacama, Chile".

> Create this directory structure and add the different projects where they
> belong.

With this structure, I can quickly look for the different events I attended on
2012.

## Step 3: Separate the Good from the Bad

This is the hardest step, but also the most important one. It's how you actually
improve your photography skills: looking at your photos with a critical eye.

Go through each photo in the project and decide if you want to keep it or not.
Just delete the photos you don't want to keep. You might not want to keep
obviously bad photos, blurred photos, or duplicated photos (keeping the best
ones).

Keep only the photos that you would show other people.

Now you can look at every selected photo and start your post-processing. You
might first try cropping the photo; trying different ratios or positions of the
objects in the photo. You might play with the colors increasing the contrast, or
converting the photo to gray scale.

This process take a lot of time but it's worth the while. You start to develop
an eye for what looks good.

Now, what happens with the very best of the best? Go one last time through your
photos, stop, breath and really look at them. Then pick the ones you would like
to share with the world. Typically, it would be only a handful of photos per
project. Star them.

## Step 4: Show and Tell

This is the best part. You now have all your photos organized! Well done!

This organization allows you to easily:

* Show the world your best photos. Just go to the project and upload your
  starred photos to your online gallery of choice.
* Show the photos of you last trip when your family visits you. Just go to the
  project and show them all your photos.
* Remember anything from your past. Just go to the project and enjoy.

## Now It's Your Turn

We just looked at one way to organize thousands of photos.

Trying to follow this way of organizing photos might be scary if you have a lot
of photos and a huge mess.

If this is the case, I recommend you to do only the first two steps now. Then,
as you are able to get some free time, go project by project, taking your time,
and reviewing your photos.

After you have finished reviewing a project, congratulate yourself and I
encourage you to share a couple of your starred photos to get some feedback.
