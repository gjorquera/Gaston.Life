title: What I'm Doing Right Now
description: |
  My current focus. Saying "no" to everything else.

_(This is a [now][now] page.)_

After thinking for a long time, I realized that I was doing too many different
things without a common theme. This meant that I couldn't transfer knowledge nor
skills from the different things I was trying out.

So, I decided that I will focus on:

1. Practicing stoicism.
1. Improving my creativity with photography.
1. Keeping physically active with [sports climbing][climb] and running.
1. Learning more through books.
