title: What I'm Doing Right Now
description: |
  My current focus. Saying "no" to everything else.
---

_(This is a [now][now] page.)_

After thinking for a long time, I realized that I was doing too many different
things without a common theme. This meant that I couldn't transfer knowledge nor
skills from the different things I was trying out.

So, I decided that I will focus on two things:
1. Core habits: Essential habits I have to force myself to do every day.
1. Extended habits: Desirable habits that I can skip every once in a while when
unexpected things happen.

# Core Habits

- Eat. Plan and prepare daily healthy meals and keep track.
- Exercise. Do calisthenics and jog for 20 minutes to maintain.
- Work. Do enough to feel good about my work but remember that there will always
  be more work than time.

# Extended Habits

- Creativity. Travel photography.
- Exercise. Indoor and rock climbing.
- Work. Âµvim and software maintainability.
- Sharing. Consolidate all my learnings and results here.
