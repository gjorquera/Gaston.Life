  My current focus. Saying "no" to everything else.
---

_(This is a [now][now] page.)_

After thinking for a long time, I realized that I was doing too many different
things without a common theme. This meant that I couldn't transfer knowledge nor
skills from the different things I was trying out.

So, I decided that I will only focus on:

1. Health: Build habits and routines to improve my sleep, meals, and exercises
  so that I can perform better at indoor climbing.
1. Work: Improve and be effective during business hours remembering that there
  will always be more work than time.
1. Sharing: Consolidate my blueprints, plans, and learnings on this site.
