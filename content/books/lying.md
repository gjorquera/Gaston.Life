## Lies

> To lie is to intentionally mislead others when they expect honest
> communication. — Sam Harris

Don't lie, even if you think a white lie is better than being honest. You don't
know when it might turn itself around and generate more harm than good.

Don't intentionally communicate something you don't believe. Others might act on
that falsehood, generating all kinds of problems that you may not be able to
predict.

Don't hide important information. It's considered misleading as you're not
communicating what you believe, when asked to.

Don't lie, but don't be a jerk. Don't say something you believe if it's only
purpose is to offend people.

Don't criticize if nobody asked you to. But when asked, be honest. Failing to
point out flaws won't prepare them when others notice the same flaws.

## Privacy

Being honest doesn't force you to communicate every fact about everything. It's
almost never useful nor practical.

You don't need to communicate personal things you'd prefer to keep private.

Be conscious of your impulses to lie. What false belief about yourself are you
trying to communicate? That's an opportunity for growth.

## Truth

Be honest, but consider that it might be different to the truth. Being honest is
to communicate your beliefs, but your beliefs might be wrong.

Communicate your uncertainty about your beliefs, when the situation requires it
too.

## Trust

> Lying is, almost by definition, a refusal to cooperate with others. It
> condenses a lack of trust and trustworthiness into a single act. — Sam Harris

Before lying, consider yourself as the one receiving the lie. You may feel
betrayed. Consider saying the information you would like to know instead of the
lie.

Don't decide yourself that you're able to make better decisions than others by
lying to them. That's just being arrogant.

Being honest is the best gift you can offer to someone. It means that you treat
them as adults, as someone that can handle your beliefs. That you trust their
decisions when they have all the information.

## Relationships

Accept the fact that committing to being honest will generate short term
discomforts. But the long term benefits will, without a doubt, outgrow them.

Beware about toxic relationships. Honesty might make them unviable. Think about
ending relationships that can't be maintained without telling lies.

## Encouragement

Don't give false encouragement. You're stealing time and energy from the person,
which may be better spent on something else. Prepare yourself to ask for
forgiveness, your beliefs about someone might be wrong.

If you're honest all the time, then your encouragement will actually mean a lot.
People will notice it, and will start looking for your opinion.

## Integrity

The best way to be honest all the time, is to live a life of integrity. You
won't have to lie and you won't feel awkward when telling your beliefs.
