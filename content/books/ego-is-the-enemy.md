  Personal skill, effort, and consistency is only a small part of success. We're
  not that good; we need other people, we need luck. Don't let ego make you
  think otherwise, don't let it think that you can be successful on your own.

Your worst enemy is your own ego: the need to be more than, better than,
recognized for, etc. It's the sense of superiority that exceeds the bounds of
your confidence and ability.

Ego prevents you from realizing that you're just not that good. It prevents
having a honest connection with the world around you.

Cultivate the ability to evaluate your own ability.

At any point in time your either aspiring something, achieved success, or
failed. Be humble in your aspirations, gracious in your success, and resilient
in your failure.

Find someone equal to you to challenge yourself, someone to learn from, and
someone to teach.

Be a student of life. The pretense of knowledge prevents you from improving.

You're always the least important person in the room until you change that with
results.

Valuable endeavors are painfully difficult. Talking is easy. Too much talking,
too much visualization, and our mind will confuse it with actual progress.

Figure out what's important to you. What you would do for the sake of doing it,
not the recognition.

Continually ask yourself: Do I need this? Or is it really about ego?

Have purpose, not passion. Busy but not accomplishing anything? That's passion.
Let purpose and reason direct you.

Don't make people _look_ good. Provide them support so that they can _be_ good.

* Come up with ideas to hand over to your boss.
* Find what nobody else wants to do and do it.
* Find inefficiencies and fix them to free up resources for new areas.
* Produce more than everyone else and give your ideas away.
* Find ways to promote _their_ creativity.

Don't protect yourself from negative feedback; protect yourself from positive
feedback.

Pride dulls your ability to receive feedback. Be honest and willing to receive
feedback, no matter how hard it is.

When you feel pride, even if you only think it, ask yourself: What are you
missing right now that a more humble person might see?

It's not ten thousand hours to mastery. There is no end zone but continual
effort. Work, work, work, forever and ever, with purpose.

Push through the pain and crappy first drafts and prototypes. It always happens.
This _is_ work.

Put yourself in situations where you're the least knowledgeable person. Grow
from that uncomfortable feeling and defensiveness you feel when all your
assumptions are challenged.

Don't reverse engineer success from other people's stories. Don't pretend that
your own story went exactly as planned.

Focus on the execution and on executing with excellence.

Success comes from work, creativity, persistence, and luck.

Saying "yes" more doesn't make you accomplish more; it prevents you from getting
what you want.

Competition is important but it's even more important to know who you're
competing with and why.

Stay on your own path without getting distracted by all the others that
intersect it.

Fight the feeling of:

* Entitlement. You haven't earned anything more than the person next to you.
* Control. It doesn't have to be your way. Perfectionism paralyzes; pointless
  battles drains energy.
* Paranoia. You're not better than everyone else. Rely on people.

When you're moving up the ladder, your system and work habits might not be what
you need in your new role. Deliberate introspection and personal organization is
required at every level.

As your responsibilities begin to change, you might end up doing less but making
more decisions. Be humble enough to put aside the more enjoyable or satisfying
parts of your previous role. Accept that others might be more qualified or
specialized to take over your previous role.

Doing the right thing is enough. Do your work. Do it well. Then let go.
Everything else is just extra.

What is your reward for suppressing your ego? Just another job well done.
Nothing more.

Don't let power make you delusional or take what you have for granted. Use that
time to prepare for the shifts of fate that will inevitably occur.

Everyone fails—sooner or later.

Don't care what other people think. Care whether you meet your own standards.

The only real failure is abandoning your principles.
