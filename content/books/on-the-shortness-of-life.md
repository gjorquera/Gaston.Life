> Learning how to live takes a whole life, and, which may surprise you more, it
> takes a whole life to learn how to die. â€” Seneca

Life is not short, we make it short.

Be grateful with what life has given you. Avoid making your life short, avoid
wasting what life has given you.

Realize that insatiable greed, dedication to useless tasks, political ambition,
worrying about other people's thoughts, pursuing other people's money or
complaining about your own, are all ways to waste your life.

Treat your time as you treat your property; guard it. It is right to be stingy
about how you spend your time.

Stop acting like an immortal in your desires. You have limited time, be content
with what you have and what you've been given.

Consider that a preoccupied mind will absorb nothing and reject everything.

Spend your time on your own needs and organize it as if were your last. This
habit will help you neither long nor fear the next day.

Expecting the future is the greatest obstacle to living today.
