  Everything you do, and don't do, is insignificant in the grand scheme of
  things. Eventually, nobody, and then nothing, will care. Stop worrying and
  start living.

Looking up the sky gives me the existential chills, too. Do it at your own risk.

Don't deny the fact that you are going to die. It's as certain as the fact that
you were born.

Don't act as if what you do will stay forever in perpetuity.

Everything that you've experienced, will last for a brief moment. Then it'll be
gone, along with you.

Realize that you are here now, and then you won't. Time will never stop, you
will never be younger again, you'll grow older and then you'll die.

Every second you waste, is a second you will never get back.

Don't wonder about what everybody else is thinking, just worry about what you
think and what you want.

If you want to be awesome, do some awesome things. If you want to be epic, do
some epic things.

The universe won't try to stop you, it's too busy creating and destroying
galaxies.

Stop waiting to receive what you want. Claim it. Pursue it. Do it.

Start now, the clock is ticking. You'll never be younger than now or have more
time left than you have now.
