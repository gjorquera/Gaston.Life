  You're already making decisions and choosing, all the time. You just need to
  change what to give a fuck about. It's going to suck. You're going to be
  nervous. You're going to freak out. You may get pissed off at people or piss
  off people. These are all necessary side effects of choosing where to place
  your fucks. Choose wisely.

Stop giving a fuck about more. Stop letting others, or life, dictate what you
should give a fuck about.

Don't follow the conventional life advice of being positive and happy. This
focuses on what you lack, on what you should have been but failed to be.
Pursuing something only makes you very aware of the fact that you don't have it.

Accept that having negative experiences and feelings — anxiety, fear, guilt — is
completely normal. What's not normal are the perfect lives people like to
showcase on social media.

Don't feel bad about feeling bad. Don't get angry about getting angry. There's
nothing wrong with you even though you're bombarded with hundreds if not
thousands of images of completely happy people with amazing lives.

Start giving a fuck about less; only about what's important to you. There's so
much going on — opportunities, experiences, stuff — that we stopped knowing what
to give a fuck about. 

Give a fuck for what's important: friends, family, purpose.

Look for the negative. Soreness and pain in the gym improves your health and
energy. Business failures are the actual lessons. Being open with your
insecurities makes you more confident. Honest confrontation builds trust.

> positive experience. — Mark Manson

Stop giving a fuck about pain and become unstoppable. Say to yourself: "I don't
want to do this, I feel like shit, but who gives a fuck?"

Enjoy the struggle, not the reward. The process, not the result. The fight, not
the victory.

Stare down your life's most difficult challenges **and take action**.

It doesn't mean being indifferent, without emotion or meaning. It means being
comfortable with being different.

It doesn't mean running away from pain. It means finding the pain that you enjoy
dealing with. What pain do you want in your life? What are you willing to
struggle for?

You can be successful only at something that you're willing to fail at.

> pain, no gain". This is the most simple and basic component of life: our
> struggles determine our success. — Mark Manson

Stop blaming others for your problems. It's easy and feels good. Solving
problems is hard and feels bad. But problems will never go away.

Don't worry about failure. Life is comprised of failures, loss, regrets, and
death. We go from wrong to slightly less wrong.

You get to choose how you think about problems, how you measure them,
controlling what problems means to you.

Happiness and satisfaction comes from solving, not running away from, problems.
New problems will come, but they will be upgraded problems.

Accept that you're average. Most of us are. Even if you're exceptional at one
thing, chances are you are average at most other things. Being average is not a
failure.

It's fine to want to improve, but obsessing over improving is believing that
you're not good enough. Life is mostly boring and that's ok.

Learn to enjoy life's most simple things: laughing with a friend, having a bath,
creating something, helping someone in need, reading a good book.

To be able to not care about difficulties, adversity, and pain, you must first
care about something more important, something bigger. Your own purpose.

Your values determine how you measure yourself, everyone, and everything else.

Think what good values you would like to live by. Good values are based on
reality, socially constructive, immediate, and controllable. They are processes.
Being honest, creative, humble. Fostering transparency. Welcoming doubt.
Expressing your emotions, both positive and negative, in a healthy way that
aligns with your values.

Avoid living by bad values. Bad values generally rely on external factors.
Self-worth and being right prevents you from learning. Always staying positive
is a form of denial. Wanting to feel good all the time is not realistic.

> Mark Manson

You don't always control what happens to you but you always have control on how
to interpret what's happened to you. Even if something bad happened to you that
wasn't your fault, it's still your responsibility to make yourself happy again.

Doubt yourself. Doubt your beliefs, your emotions, your thoughts about your
future. Doubt what you know about yourself. Look for how you're wrong and learn
from it.

Never stop finding yourself, never know who you are. Let go of the stories you
tell yourself about yourself. Free yourself to act, fail, and grow.

Give up your sense of entitlement. Measure yourself by mundane standards: a
student, a partner, a friend, a creator. You're not special. You're not unique.
You're not an undiscovered genius.

Learn to look and evaluate different values before deciding whether to adopt
them or not. It's a skill that requires practice.

When you choose a new value, you're choosing a new pain. When you're feeling
this new pain, don't try to numb it. Act despite it.

Be comfortable with saying and hearing the word "no". Choosing is by definition
rejecting the alternatives.

> We are defined by what we choose to reject. And if we reject nothing, we
> essentially have no identity at all. — Mark Manson

Take responsibility for your own values and problems. Choose to support and be
supported, but don't ask for someone else to be responsible for you. People
can't solve your problems for you and they shouldn't try.

Being honest is a good value. Being honest in a relationship should be more
important than feeling good.

Just shut up and do it.
