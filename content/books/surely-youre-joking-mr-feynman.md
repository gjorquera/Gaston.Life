  Feynman's stories are awesome. His curiosity and focused personality allowed
  him to pursue a lot of interesting—but arguably useless—experiences that ended
  up filled with life lessons. He definitely enjoyed his life.

_These notes are not a summary of his stories but the lessons that I was able to
extract from his stories. His stories are much, much better._
understand Feynman a little bit better then definitely read his book._

There is always resistance to innovation, to doing things differently. The
people that are before you are the _smart_ ones, the ones that made it to where
they are and they are not always open to new ideas.

Understanding groups interests and strengths can help build synergies. This
requires both parties to understand how they can benefit from each other's
strengths.

The clueless isn't wrong just because he's clueless. They can still come up with
good ideas.

Cultural differences are important and must be considered.

Surround yourself with people solving harder and harder problems. Help others
solve their problems.

Try new things even if you don't understand them. Do them for the fun, to see
what's going to happen and where things lead to.

It's your responsibility to feel comfortable where you are.

People often forget what they know if you take the knowledge out of the context
they are used to. Every once in a while try challenging someone on what they
already know.

People remember their own ideas, feelings, and conclusions about events. Not the
actual events.

Assumptions change.

It's important to know both the good and the bad. To find out how the rest of
the world is. It's not helpful to always go to the best place possible.

Understand what social cues and habits mean. Don't expect for everyone to be
explicit, direct, nor honest.

Analogies are helpful to explain a subject given another subject but there's no
intrinsic value in the analogies themselves.

Theories are not reality. They are tools to understand reality.

Don't memorize useless stuff that can be looked up.

Always be tolerant of other ideas even if they are different from what you think
or propose.

We don't think in abstract terms by nature. We're concrete people. When
explaining things make up examples.

If you want to know secrets, ask the questions to make the other person feel
proud when giving the answer.

Models to simplify reality are helpful to understand complex things but keep in
mind that they are still _simplifications_.

Bravery is doing something even though you _know_ it's terrible. Doing things
you're afraid of for the second time.

When discussing ideas, don't repeat what other people say. Remeber them,
consider them, and build better solutions on top of them.

Understanding the problem is essential. That's what allows people to invent ways
of doing things better and better.

Don't worry about who you're talking to. Consider only the technical issues. If
the idea is bad, say it's bad. If it's good, say it's good.

Always address the root cause otherwise you're fooling yourself in thinking
you've fixed the problem. Fix the class of problems, not each instance of the
problem.

Have something that you can come back to. Something that you're good at and
doesn't take you too much effort. Something that you can depend on when other
parts of your career gets difficult.

Teaching the basics, even if you know them very well, might be fun and
delighful. It doesn't do any harm to go over them every once in a while. It may
even be refreshing.

Learn from everyone who has something to teach you regardless of who they are.
You probably know nothing about most things.

Visualization and building up an attitude is important to address situations in
a deliberate way.

Making decisions to always do things a certain way frees you up from having to
make the decision over and over again. Decide and forget.

What you've always wanted might not be good for you. Know yourself. Decline what
you've always wanted if you know it will be bad for you.

Before arguing about something be sure to understand the other person's point of
view.

If you've made up your mind to test something out, then communicate the result
regardless of the outcome.
