  Time management techniques has nothing to do with managing time. Spend time
  doing the right things instead of doing many things. Being busy isn't
  valuable. Accept that everyone leaves things undone, but decide to leave the
  least important ones undone.

Time management is not about managing time. It doesn't matter if you have the
perfect tools or if you were able to cram up every waking minute of your day
with tasks.

If you're doing too many thing you'll end up exhausted without enjoying life.

If you're doing the wrong things you'll end up where you never wanted to be.

If you're not doing anything you'll end up hating that “freedom” and reacting to
whatever happens around you.

Accomplishment comes with the right mindset. Decide what your future should look
like. Decide to do the right things. Decide to stop being always busy.

Stop trying to manage time and start managing yourself.

Planning is very helpful even if things don't always go as planned. Don't try to
follow plans to the letter. Always leave extra space when making plans. Adjust
them when new information arises and keep moving.

Adapt to situations you have no control over. Practice your influence in
situations where you have some control. Choose when you have total control.
Learn to know the difference.

There's too much of everything, except time. Simplify your life by removing
those unimportant things. A declutered mind can have peace and clearer
priorities. Choose well so you can live the life you want.

Think and decide what is right for you. Who you want to become. What you want to
accomplish. What relationships you want to strengthen. Only after you have a
clear direction, you'll be able to focus on doing the right tasks.

Don't let the opinion of others deviate your direction. Learn to decide for
yourself.

Spend more time working than organizing your work. Compulsive organization is
another form of procrastination.

Reduce the amount of time you waste. We all need to rest, but there may be some
excess you can reduce. Excessive television. Excessive internet. Excessive
reading.

Reduce the amount of time you spend on other people's priorities.

Consider your commitments and responsibilities. If it's important, you have to
do it.

Focus and work on your priorities. These are usually important but not urgent
things. Use your reclaimed time and enjoy the gratification of working towards
the life you want.

If you still want to do too many things, maybe it's time to let go of some.
Focus on the most important.

We live in a complex world. Find a tool to help you remember tasks,
responsibilities, and information. Your brain alone won't be enough.

Figure out your priorities.

Every week review what you did last week and plan the next. Look for places of
improvement. Choose to work on the tasks that'll have the biggest impact on your
priorities.

Every day review what you did yesterday. Move what's undone and decide on the
most important tasks you should finish today.

Revisit your goals and priorities periodically. It's important to always work
with the most updated assumptions.
