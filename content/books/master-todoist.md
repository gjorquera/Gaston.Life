You can't store all your ideas, tasks, and appointments in your mind. Life is
just too complicated.

Develop the habit of capturing everything that comes to your mind in one place
and the habit of periodically reviewing them. Only by doing so, you'll be able
let go and fully concentrate on the task at hand.

## Tasks

There are six different types of tasks that you can store in Todoist: habit
building, appointments, ideas, actions, projects, and processes.

### Habit Building

Use Todoist's recurrent tasks and reminders feature to get you to do something at
a specific time or location.

To keep consistency, create small, realistic habit building tasks, that you can
complete daily even if you feel a lack of interest.

Aim to do much more than the task requires to be completed. If you don't have a
lot of time or energy, force yourself to do the bare minimum to keep momentum.

### Appointments

Tasks that requires you to be at a certain place and time.

Make sure your appointment tasks are added with time in Todoist, so you can have
something very similar to your daily calendar at the top of the Todoist's Today
view.

### Ideas

Tasks that are usually not actionable and very big in scope. Anything that pops
into your head that you want to remember and evaluate at some time in the
future.

Whenever an idea pops into your head, regardless of when and where, add it to
Todoist's Inbox and then let go.

### Actions

Tasks that are well defined and reduced in scope that don't require too much
advanced planning.

Should be completed in a few hours or less.

### Projects

Tasks that require more than one concrete action to complete. Use Todoist's
projects to group tasks together. A project can include dates and milestones.

Don't try to specify every action required to complete the project. Focus on a
handful of actionable tasks that are the next steps. That's more than enough to
start working.

Keep adding actions, after you've started working on the project and after you
have more information, by asking yourself "what is the next step?".

Projects can be done in a day or they can take weeks.

### Processes

Projects that you know beforehand the actions needed to be completed.

After completing a couple of the same type of projects, you can convert it into
a checklist or template that can be reused in the future.

For example: planning and packing for a weekend trip, publishing a blog post,
writing and publishing book notes.

## Doing the Work

### Daily Ritual

Every morning pick the three Most Important Tasks that will have the biggest
impact on your career: two related to a project with an immediate deadline and
one related to a long-term goal.

Use red flag, orange flag, and yellow flag priorities to the first, second, and
third Most Important Task.

A task can be a priority only if it's time sensitive or crucial to your
long-term success. The only way to complete your priorities is not by marking
them as priorities but by not doing things that are actually not priorities.

Finishing all the tasks in your day is not as important as finishing your Most
Important Tasks.

> perfectly okay to not achieve Todoist Zero. — S. J. Scott

Always ask yourself "what is the next step?" when looking at your projects.

Explicitly block out time in your calendar for high priority tasks and for tasks
that require a lot of concentration. Plan for these tasks to take a lot of time
to avoid feeling anxious because you're not making progress as fast as you'd
like.

### Batching

Don't jump from project to project and from type of task to type of task.
Context switching is very expensive.

Use labels to batch related tasks. Then you can filter your tasks by label and
do all of them in batch.

For example: tasks you can finish in under 5 minutes, or tasks you need to do
over the phone, or tasks you're waiting on that needs pinging someone.

### Eisenhower Matrix

Use filters to implement Eisenhower's priority matrix based on urgency and
importance.

* Q1: Urgent and important — `(overdue | today) & (p1 | p2 | p3)`.
* Q2: Important but not urgent — `(no date) & (p1 | p2 | p3)`.
* Q3: Urgent but not important — `(overdue, toda)`.
* Q4: Not important and not urgent — `(no date)`.

### Weekly Ritual

Every week review your goals and projects and decide the what you want to focus
on this week. Don't fill your week to every minute, leave space for unexpected
commitments.

Answer the following questions:

* What are my personal obligations?
* What are my priority projects?
* How much time do I have?
* What are the next actions on my Todoist projects?
* Is there anything on the Someday/Maybe project that I'd like to focus on this
  week?

### Your Life as Projects

Create a parent project for every aspect of your life: career, finance, health,
leisure, relationships, service, spirituality.

Limit the number of projects you want to pursue in the short term to only five.

Create an extra "someday/maybe" project for all those ideas that you'd like to
pursue soon but not right now. This is where you think big.

### Your Goal in Life

Don't complete tasks for the sake of completing them.

Use Todoist to help you keep laser focused into the projects that will most
impact your life and achieve your life-long goals.

One action at a time, one project at a time.
