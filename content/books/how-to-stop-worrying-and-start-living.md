Your business is not to see what lies dimly at a distance but to do what lies
clearly at hand.

Live every day compartmentalized. Shut out the dead yesterdays and the unborn
tomorrows.

The best way to prepare for tomorrow is to concentrate and do your absolute best
today.

Plan for tomorrow but have no anxiety for it.

Think good. Deal with cause and effect that leads to logical, constructive
planning. Don't think bad. It leads to tension and nervous breakdowns.

Visualize grains of sand passing through the narrow neck of an hourglass. Those
are your tasks being addressed one by one throughout the day.

Don't underestimate the results of normal but constant efforts.

Be content living the only time you can live: from now until bedtime.

When something is worrying you:

* Analyze the situation fearlessly and honestly. Figure out what's the worst
  that can happen as a result of your failure.
* Reconcile yourself to accept it.
* Devote your time and energy to improve upon the worst which you already
  accepted.

Accepting the worst means you have nothing else to lose but everything to gain.

Don't let worry destroy your ability to concentrate.

> True peace of mind comes from accepting the worst. — Dale Carnegie
