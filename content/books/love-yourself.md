Repeat to yourself "I love myself" all the time until it becomes the anchor, the
one true thing.

Don't give things more importance than what they deserve. Don't care about
anything else. Just love yourself. Life loves you back when you love yourself.

> Your job is purely to love yourself. Truly and deeply. Feel it. Again and
> again. — Kamal Ravikant

Most of the time you think you're thinking but you're actually remembering. One
though, even if it has emotional intensity, has no control over you. Remembering
it again and again will end up controlling you.

When dealing with the world, before reacting, ask yourself this question: "If I
loved myself, would I let myself experience this? Would I let myself be affected
by this?"

When dealing with regret, say to yourself: "I can't erase the past, only learn
from it. It's ok."

When dealing with fear, say to yourself: "It's ok".

When dealing with negative thoughts, say to yourself: "Not useful".

> Rather than reacting to situations, I found myself choosing how I wanted to
> be. — Kamal Ravikant

Simple meditation:

* Put on soothing, gentle, preferably instrumental music.
* Sit with your back against the wall.
* Close your eyes and smile gently.
* Breath in and mentally say "I love myself".
* Breath out and, along with it, anything that arises.
