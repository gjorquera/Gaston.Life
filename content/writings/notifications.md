I bought my first smartphone because I wanted to have my calendar accessible
from my computer and phone. I kept forgetting my appointments and scheduling
several things at the same time. Sounds reasonable, right?

Fast forward a couple of years and I found myself compulsively checking my
phone. At first I was just trying to take advantage of idle moments while
commuting or when waiting for something. By the end, I was checking my phone
before even getting out of bed, while having dinner (and watching TV), while
trying to work, even while having a good time with some friends.

What was I looking for in my phone? Apparently, [highly addictive
dopamine][dopamine]. It feels good to see that someone reached out to me, that
there was something new for me. But feeling anxious after spending too much time
without checking my phone? That's not so good.

I know I'm not alone on this.

It was impacting my productivity. Several personal productivity techniques, such
as the [Pomodoro Technique][pomodoro] and [Time Blocking][time-blocking] have
the following thing in common: context switching is a huge productivity hit.

And guess what? Notifications make you switch contexts constantly.

Let's not forget the social impact and annoyance of being with someone who is
constantly checking their phone. A photographer edited out our phones from some
photos, [the result is shocking][photo-phones]. I was one of them. And I didn't
want to. Stupid and awesome dopamine.

After reading [Minimalism][minimalism] (a great read by the way) I decided that
I want to live in a more meaningful and balanced way.

And my phone addiction was not helping.

So, I decided to quit the bad habit and addiction of constantly checking my
phone. Following Leo Babauta tips on [quitting bad habits][bad-habits], this is
what I did:

1. I told my significant other that I will [answer messages
eventually][emergencies]. If it’s something more urgent or important, it's
better to call me.
1. Remove one of the triggers. I disabled all notifications that goes to my lock
screen. Only calls can interrupt me (luckily, I don't receive calls frequently,
so it's not a problem for me).
1. My inner trigger of unlocking my phone, even without notifications, was still
there. To avoid that, I decided to [breathe][breathe]. If I want to look at my
phone, let's do it by intention, not by impulse.
1. I scheduled several fixed times throughout the day when I can unlock my phone
and process all notifications in batch. I left the badge number notification on
so I don't have to open all apps looking for new things.

On an iPhone you can configure each application following these steps:

1. Go to Settings > Notifications > Select an App.
1. Enable "Allow Notifications".
1. Disable "Show in Notification Center", "Sounds", and "Show on Lock Screen".
1. Leave "Badge App Icon" enabled.
1. Select "None" on "Alert Style When Unlocked".
1. Do this for every app you want to receive notifications.
1. To completely disable notifications for an app, disable "Allow
  Notifications".

This configuration cleaned up a lot of my time and attention. Now, when I'm with
someone, I'm not worried about things other people on other places are doing.

The sensation of not being controlled by your phone is great. It helped me to
focus on "right now".

On a related note, I still own a regular watch. I like to know the time, and my
watch helps me to avoid triggering the impulse to unlock the phone. This is why
I don't want to own a smart watch, I don't want notifications closer to me.

Now it's your time, disable your phone notifications. It will clean up some of
your mental clutter.
